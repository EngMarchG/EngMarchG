## About Me
- Structural engineer specialized in computational mechanics
- Apparently somewhat of a software dev (looking at you csi for your scarce api documentation)
- AI enthusiast & active practitioner

Ps: Someone explain why I randomly get teleported into the future when I get into my coding cycle ðŸ¤”
